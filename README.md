Hello!

This is my first and ongoing project of developing a game utilizing Unity and C#. The purpose of this being here is to help demonstrate my eagerness and determination to learn.
I am completely self-taught and while this project is an assignment for the Unity Programmer course, I wanted to push myself to beyond what they were asking me to do.

Thank you for taking the time to look at what I currently have, all art and assets have been created by me.
